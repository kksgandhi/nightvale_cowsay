The optimist says the glass is half full. The pessimist says the glass is half empty. It is only the truth seeker who wonders, why is the glass there? Why is there water all over the floor? Why is it covering every other surface of the house? Who or what is doing this to us?

Bananas are hardly that slippery. But watch your step anyway.

At a loss for words? Here's a few you can use:

No one has seen the trees this week. Hopefully, they'll come back soon.
%
A friendly desert community where the sun is still hot, the moon still beautiful, and mysterious lights still pass overhead while we all pretend to sleep.
%
Does it even matter how many living things you touch today, or where they all are now?
%
It takes heart. It takes guts. It also takes cash. It just needs your payment immediately.
%
The arctic is lit by the midnight sun. The surface of the moon is lit by the face of the earth. Our little town is lit, too, by lights just above that we cannot explain.
%
You take the good, you take the bad. You take them both, and there you have spiders crawling out of a red velvet cupcake.

The riddle says, 'He walks on four legs in the morning. He walks on two legs at midday. And at night, he slithers from dream to dream effortlessly, like the air we breathe. And we love him.'

%
Mountains. Endless mountains! Peak after barren peak. And what lies, restless, in the shadowed valleys? I cannot say. I cannot say!

There is a thin semantic line separating weird and beautiful, and that line is covered in jellyfish.
%
Life is like a box of chocolates: unopened, dusty, and beginning to attract a lot of insects.
%
"You'll be safe here," says a whisper behind you.
%
Your existence is not impossible, but it's also not very likely.
%
Trust everyone.

Perhaps you noticed something strange yesterday. And perhaps you have forgotten it.

Red sky at night. Sailor's delight.
Red sky at night, the sailors are howling and laughing.
The sailors begin to surround us, and the night sky is so very red.

Regret nothing, until it is too late. Then regret everything.
%
The desert seems vast, even endless, and yet scientists tell us that somewhere, even now, there is snow.

At last, we are alone. At last we are, all of us, alone together. At last, every human, alone together, on this earth.
%
